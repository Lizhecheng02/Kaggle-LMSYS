On physical exam, she appears well developed and pleasant. She sits listening to the conversation and follows directions. Palpation of the heart reveals a mild parasternal heave. Auscultation reveals a normal S1 but the S2 is split and remains split during inhalation and exhalation. Additionally, there is a medium pitched midsystolic murmur that is loudest between ribs 2 and 3 on the left side and a very soft diastolic rumble.
